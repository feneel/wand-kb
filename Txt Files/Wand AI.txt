**One-liner:** Wand builds the **operating system for hybrid workforces** (humans + AI agents) to design, manage, and scale agent teams safely. ([Wand AI][7])

**What you get:** Creation, execution, collaboration, and governance for agents in one platform. ([Wand AI][8])

**Notable modules:** *Agent University* (train/re-train agents) and *Agent Economy* (tools/data marketplace). ([Wand AI][8])

**Why it matters:** Moves beyond single agents to **division/process automation** with human-in-the-loop escalation by confidence. ([Wand AI][9])
