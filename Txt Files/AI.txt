# File 3 — AI (Very Short Primer)

**Definition (OECD):** Machine-based systems that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infer from inputs how to generate outputs (predictions, content, decisions) that influence the world. ([OECD AI][11])

**Key buckets:** ML (supervised/unsupervised), deep learning, reinforcement learning, and foundation models. ([Stanford HAI][12])

**Typical lifecycle:** Problem → data → train/validate → deploy → monitor (accuracy, drift, safety). ([NIST][13])

**Benefits:** Automation, decision support, personalization. **Risks:** Bias, privacy/security, misuse, reliability. Use risk frameworks (e.g., **NIST AI RMF**) to manage. ([NIST][13])

**Current trend:** Enterprises pair foundation models with **RAG** or fine-tuning to ground answers in private data. ([The Wall Street Journal][4])
